On-the-fly syntax checking for GNU Emacs (aka "flymake done right")

Provide `flycheck-mode' which enables on-the-fly syntax checking for a large
number of different modes and languages (see `flycheck-checkers' for a
complete list).

Support for new modes and languages can be added by declaring a new syntax
checker.
